fibmapsort - sorts a list of files according to their first block

fibmapsort sorts a list of files according to the number of their first block.
This is usually a good approximation of sorting the list of files according to
their position in the media, which reduces seek time. It is very useful when
reading from optical media.

To obtain the number of the first block, it uses the FIBMAP ioctl (thus the
name fibmapsort). This means it will only work when run as root.

Sample usage:
	find . -type f -print0 | fibmapsort -0 | xargs -0 md5sum

Command line arguments:
	-0	uses the NUL character as the delimiter instead of newline
	-b	prints the number of the first block for each file
